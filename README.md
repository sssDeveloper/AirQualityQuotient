# Problem Statement

Throughout the world people are migrating from rural areas to cities in search of better livelihood. As cities are growing in size they are faced with new challenges. A growing city results in usage of more vehicles and  resources leading to more carbon emission which ultimately results in degradation of air quality. Major cities in India and China facing air quality issue have made global headlines in the recent years with New Dehli being its poster child. Every winter the issue gets aggravated and the city becomes unliveable. But citizens in other cities might not relaize the extent of poor air quality.

# How are we helping

AirQualityQuotient will provide meaningful insights and tools on how air quality of the city has changed over the years. This will empower activists and citizens with necessary information to question policy makers and bring about a change for the better and increase livability and sustainabilty of the city.

# MVP for hackathon and Future

## MVP

Hackathons come with time constraints, given the limited time below are the features of our solution 
* Visualization provides ability to view different air quality parameters across the globe for major cities for time period selected. Visualization can be integrated into thrid party applications.
* Visualization provides ability to select a particular city and view different air quality parameters for the time period selected. Visualization can be integrated into thrid party applications
* ML algorithm to forecast PPM count for NewDelhi with range slider showing visualization of historical data as jupyter notebook.

## Future
    
* AirQualityQuotient will leverage machine learning and forecast different air quality paramteres for multiple cities.
* Expose forecasted air quality paramters as a API service for thrid party developers to integrate within their application.

# How did we do it

Our solution leverages the power of cloud and is built on top of AWS managed services. Architecture covers current and future state of our application implementation.
